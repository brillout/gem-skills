## Adding or changing a skill

Edit `skills.json`, then run `pnpm run check`, which rejects any tag outside the vocabulary. Tag values and their meanings are listed under `facets` in `skills.json` and on the site's [Tags](https://brillout.github.io/gemskills/#/tags) page.

1. Read the skill's SKILL.md itself, not only its one-line description.
2. Give it one `type:` and one `effect:`, judged by the skill's own steps.
3. List every `needs:` value that applies. Use `needs:none` only when nothing does.
4. Add a `stack:` tag for each technology or service the skill is about.
5. Add one to five topics, preferring existing ones.
6. Add a `flag:` only with evidence, such as a matching original or a retirement notice.
7. Record the `audit:` result from the skill's skills.sh page.

## Development

```bash
pnpm install
pnpm run dev     # site at http://localhost:3000
pnpm run check   # validate skills.json and type-check
pnpm run build   # build the site into site/dist
```

Every push to the default branch rebuilds the site and publishes it to the `gh-pages` branch, which GitHub Pages serves.
